## Contributing

If you wish to contribute more on this project or create your own converter, you might want to start by creating a new directory structure for conversion between the two versions. Copy the content of `import.php` file and focus on the `DataHandler` class to handle your specific data conversion needs. Interfaces and reusable classes might be provided in the future and any PR for this is welcomed.
